# EDA-Exploratory-Data-Analysis
Welcome to the TED Talks EDA repository! This project provides an in-depth exploratory data analysis of TED Talks, examining factors that may influence their popularity, measured through views and likes.

## Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that walks through the process of performing EDA on a dataset of TED Talks. The analysis is structured to help uncover patterns and insights that could explain why certain talks garner more attention than others.
